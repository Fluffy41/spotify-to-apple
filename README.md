# Spotify to Apple Music Playlist Sync

Welcome to **Spotify to Apple Music Playlist Sync**! This project allows you to sync your Spotify playlists to Apple Music playlists (with some limitations due to API restrictions). It's a great tool for anyone who wants to keep their music library consistent across both platforms.

---

### Features

- Fetch your Spotify playlists and tracks.
- Create new playlists in Apple Music (or attempt to, based on available API).
- Sync your Spotify playlist to a new Apple Music playlist with the same track names.

### **Disclaimer:**

The Apple Music integration might **not** work as expected due to API limitations and **the fact that I don't want to pay for the Apple Music API**. So, while the code for fetching and creating playlists is there, the syncing part might not function unless you have a paid Apple Developer account and access to their API. **Use at your own risk** and with the understanding that the Apple Music syncing is unverified.
